# Customization

## Philosophy

Users should always feel like they're in control. Be mindful of being too prescriptive, leave basic customizations up to them and try to avoid changing things they may have already changed unless there's a good reason.

## Required and Suggested

Required items are always installed while suggested items are presented to the developer who can choose which ones to install.
