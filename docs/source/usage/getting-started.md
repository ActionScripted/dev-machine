# Getting Started

The endgame is a script that runs on developer machines: `dev-machine setup`.

You're going to have a configuration for your team that will install required items and show suggested items to developers who can choose which ones to install.

We will refer to your team as some flavor of `myorg` which is meant to be a slug of your organization's name and something you replace as you follow along.

## Requirements

## Step 1: Create a Project

```bash
mkdir dev-machine--myorg
cd dev-machine--myorg

# some curl thing here

git init
git commit -am "repo init"
```
