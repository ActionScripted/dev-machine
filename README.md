# dev-machine

Automate and maintain developer machine setup. Works with macOS, ~Windows~ and ~Debian-based Linux~.

Overview: bash > brew/choco > docker > asible

## Getting Started

The endgame is a script that runs on developer machines: `dev-machine setup`. You're going to have a configuration for your organization or team and if there's something you need please [open an issue](#open-an-issue).

We will refer to your organization as some flavor of `myorg` which is meant to be a slug of your organization's name and something you replace as you follow along.

### Step 1: Create a Project

```bash
mkdir dev-machine--myorg
cd dev-machine--myorg

# some curl thing here

git init
git commit -am "repo init"
```
